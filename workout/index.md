## Workout structure

Workout:

* Each workout consists of a round of 6 supersets that are roughly categorised as:
  * lower body, upper body, lower body, upper body, abs, correction
* These rounds can be done 1-3x times

Supersets:

* These sets are all same-muscle "supersets", meaning they consist of multiple sets of exercises that target the same muscles
* The supersets consist of 3x exercises performed continuously for a minute each, one after another without rest
* 1-minute rest between sets but no scheduled rest within a set
  * You can rest-pause if needed (if you can't continue, then rest a few seconds and try again)

Exercise sets:

* Each superset consists of exercise sets that need to be performed as "drop sets", meaning that when you can no longer continue you should drop the difficulty and continue with an easier variation until you've done 1 minute
* These are all bodyweight exercises, so variations in difficulty are achieved by altering the exercise in different ways (instead of using different weights)
