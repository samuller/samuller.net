A quick summary of the common calls that can be made on the field when playing Ultimate frisbee according to the 2021 [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/). Relevant rule numbers are stated in <span class="ref-link">square brackets</span> and **bolded** words represent the exact word called on the field.

## Infractions

Infractions are calls that do not stop play <span class="ref-link">[15.2,18.2.6]</span> (unless contested <span class="ref-link">[18.1.2, 18.2.9]</span>). The mistake only needs to be corrected in some way, but play continues.

There are only two 'types' of infraction <span class="ref-link">[15.2]</span>:
- **Travel** <span class="ref-link">[18.2]</span>: whenever the person catching the disc does not stop as fast as possible, or they change direction after properly catching <span class="ref-link">[18.2.5.1]</span>, or they establish a pivot point at an invalid position (e.g. out of bounds) <span class="ref-link">[18.2.5.3]</span>
- Marking infractions <span class="ref-link">[18.1]</span>, of which there are 6 types, are usually due to some action of the defending *marker* against the *thrower*
  - **Fast count**: counting faster than 1 second intervals or making any other counting mistake (starting count, ordering, etc.) <span class="ref-link">[18.1.1.1]</span>
  - **Straddle**: a line between the defender's feet are closer than one disc diameter from the thrower's pivot point <span class="ref-link">[18.1.1.2]</span>
  - **Disc space**: a mark being too close to the thrower, i.e. less than one disc diameter from the thrower's torso <span class="ref-link">[18.1.1.3]</span>
  - **Wrapping**: a line between the defender's hands are closer than one disc diameter from the thrower's torso <span class="ref-link">[18.1.1.4]</span>
  - **Double team**: more than one defender within 3 meters - unless they're marking another offensive player within 3m, or are just running across this area <span class="ref-link">[18.1.1.5]</span>
  - **Vision**: a defensive player uses any part of their body to intentionally obstruct the thrower's vision <span class="ref-link">[18.1.1.6]</span>

## Violations

All non-infractions are violations <span class="ref-link">[15.3]</span>. Violations lead to a stoppage of play for discussion <span class="ref-link">[16.1]</span>.

&nbsp;
{: style="margin-bottom: -16px"}
- Marking violation <span class="ref-link">[18.1.5]</span>: can be called when marking infractions are not corrected <span class="ref-link">[18.1.5.1]</span> or are repeated <span class="ref-link">[18.1.5.4]</span>
- **Pick** <span class="ref-link">[18.3]</span>: if a defensive player is guarding one offensive player (within 3 meters) and they are prevented from moving towards/with that player by another (obstructing) player, that defensive player may call "Pick" (unless the obstructing player is making a play on the disc) <span class="ref-link">[18.3.1]</span>
- **Offside** <span class="ref-link">[7.5]</span>: when players are not behind the line during the pull <span class="ref-link">[7.4]</span>
- **Violation**: a generic violation call can be made for any other calls that might not have specific call-outs, e.g. marking violations, obstructions near/on the field <span class="ref-link">[2.7]</span> or intentionally initiating minor contact <span class="ref-link">[15.1.1]</span>

## Fouls

A **foul** is a type of violation caused by a breach of the rules due to dangerous play <span class="ref-link">[17.1]</span> or *non-minor contact* between two or more opposing players <span class="ref-link">[15.1]</span>.

- **Strip** <span class="ref-link">[17.3]</span>: a foul that causes the thrower to drop a disc they properly caught
- There are mutiple types of foul, but they usually all use the same call-out ("**Foul**"):
  - Dangerous play, Receiving, Strip, Blocking, Force-out, Defensive throwing (Marking), Offensive throwing (Thrower), Indirect and Offsetting fouls
  - The different types affect how the result is resolved <span class="ref-link">[17.1-17.9]</span>
  - If the fouled team retains or gains possession of the disc, they can continue without stoppage after a foul call, *if* the player that called the foul then calls "**Play on**" as soon as possible <span class="ref-link">[16.2.4.1]</span>
  - If *both* the *event* and the *call* did not affect play, then it can be ignored <span class="ref-link">[16.3]</span>

### Minor contact

Contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the movements or position of another player.

Contact with an opponentâ€™s extended arms or hands that are about to, or already are, contacting the disc, or contact to the throwers hand during the throwing motion, is *not* considered to be minor contact. <span class="ref-link">[definitions]</span>

## Other stoppages

- **Injury** <span class="ref-link">[19.1]</span>: when a player is injured - if this is called and they weren't injured by an opponent, they must either be substituted or else use a time-out <span class="ref-link">[19.1.2]</span>
- **Technical** <span class="ref-link">[19.2]</span>: any condition that endangers players on the field
- **Time-out**: a limited number of time-outs can be used, depending on the league/tournament <span class="ref-link">[20]</span>
- **Equipment**: any player may briefly *extend* a stoppage of play to fix faulty equipment, but active play may not be stopped for this purpose <span class="ref-link">[10.3]</span>
