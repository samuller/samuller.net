A quick summary of the common calls that can be made on the field when playing Ultimate frisbee according to the 2021 [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/). Relevant rule numbers are stated in square brackets and **bolded** words represent the exact word called on the field.

## Infractions

Infractions are calls that do not stop play [15.2]. The mistake only needs to be corrected in some way, but play continues.

There are only two 'types' of infraction [15.2]:
- **Travel** [18.2]: whenever the person catching the disc does not stop as fast as possible, or they change direction after properly catching [18.2.5.1], or they establish a pivot point at an invalid position (e.g. out of bounds) [18.2.5.3]
- Marking infractions [18.1], of which there are 6 types, are usually due to some action of the defending *marker* against the *thrower*
  - **Fast count**: counting faster than 1 second intervals or making any other counting mistake (starting count, ordering, etc.) [18.1.1.1]
  - **Straddle**: a line between the defender's feet are closer than one disc diameter from the thrower's pivot point [18.1.1.2]
  - **Disc space**: a mark being too close to the thrower, i.e. less than one disc diameter from the thrower's torso [18.1.1.3]
  - **Wrapping**: a line between the defender's hands are closer than one disc diameter from the thrower's torso [18.1.1.4]
  - **Double team**: more than one defender within 3 meters - unless they're marking another offensive player within 3m, or are just running across this area [18.1.1.5]
  - **Vision**: a defensive player uses any part of their body to intentionally obstruct the thrower's vision [18.1.1.6]

## Violations

All non-infractions are violations [15.3]. Violations lead to a stoppage of play for discussion [16.1].

- Marking violation [18.1.5]: can be called when marking infractions are not corrected [18.1.5.1] or are repeated [18.1.5.4]
- **Pick** [18.3]: if a defensive player is guarding one offensive player (within 3 meters) and they are prevented from moving towards/with that player by another (obstructing) player, that defensive player may call "Pick" (unless the obstructing player is making a play on the disc) [18.3.1]
- **Offside** [7.5]: when players are not behind the line during the pull [7.4]
- **Violation**: a generic violation call can be made for any other calls that might not have specific call-outs, e.g. obstructions near/on the field [2.7] or intentionally initiating minor contact [15.1.1]

## Fouls

A **foul** is a type of violation caused by a breach of the rules due to dangerous play [17.1] or *non-minor contact* between two or more opposing players [15.1].

- **Strip** [17.3]: a foul that causes the thrower to drop a disc they properly caught
- There are mutiple types of foul, but they usually all use the same call-out ("**Foul**"):
  - Dangerous play, Receiving, Strip, Blocking, Force-out, Defensive throwing (Marking), Offensive throwing (Thrower), Indirect and Offsetting fouls
  - The different types affect how the result is resolved [17.1-17.9]
  - If the fouled team retains or gains possession of the disc, they can continue without stoppage after a foul call, *if* the player that called the foul then calls "**Play on**" as soon as possible [16.2.4.1]
  - If *both* the *event* and the *call* did not affect play, then it can be ignored [16.3]

### Minor contact

Contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the movements or position of another player.

Contact with an opponentâ€™s extended arms or hands that are about to, or already are, contacting the disc, or contact to the throwers hand during the throwing motion, is *not* considered to be minor contact. [definitions]

## Other stoppages

- **Injury** [19.1]: when a player is injured; if they weren't injured by an opponent, they must either be substituted or use a time-out [19.1.2]
- **Technical** [19.2]: any condition that endangers players
- **Time-out**: a limited number of time-outs can be used, depending on the league/tournament [20]
- **Equipment**: any player may briefly *extend* a stoppage of play to fix faulty equipment, but active play may not be stopped for this purpose [10.3]
