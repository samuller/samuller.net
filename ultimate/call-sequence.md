A quick summary of how calls should be handled on the field when playing Ultimate frisbee according to the 2021 [WFDF rules](https://rules.wfdf.org/).

## Who can make a call

- **Travel**: any defensive player <span class="ref-link">[15.5.1]</span>
- Any marking infraction: only the thrower <span class="ref-link">[15.5]</span>
  - Except for **Double team** which can be called by any offensive player <span class="ref-link">[15.5.1]</span>
- **Violation**: any opposing player, but there are exceptions for specific violation types <span class="ref-link">[15.6]</span>
- **Foul**: only the fouled player <span class="ref-link">[15.4]</span>
- **Pick**: the defensive player who was obstructed <span class="ref-link">[18.3.1]</span>
- **Contest**/**uncontest**: players directly involved in the play, and players who had the best perspective <span class="ref-link">[1.10]</span>, with possible involvement of the captains <span class="ref-link">[1.10.2]</span>

## When can they make the call

- Calls must be made immediately after the breach is recognised <span class="ref-link">[15.8]</span>
- **Pick**: prior to making the "Pick" call, the defender may delay the call up to two (2) seconds to determine if the obstruction will affect the play <span class="ref-link">[18.3.1.1]</span>

## Discussion options

Once a **foul** or **violation** is called, a 'discussion' starts and there are multiple ways to respond. We list the options and give an indication of some types of results, however the exact consequences require the detailed rules:
1. **Uncontested**/no contest/call accepted: if the opposing team does not disagree with the call then they usually just need to correct the issue caused by the foul, e.g.:
  - give possession to fouled player who would've caught disc <span class="ref-link">[17.2.2]</span>
  - allow defender to make up position <span class="ref-link">[17.8.2]</span>
  - change the stall count (either reset to: 1 <span class="ref-link">[9.5.1, 17.6.1.3]</span>, or max 9 <span class="ref-link">[9.5.2, 9.6]</span>, or subtract 2 <span class="ref-link">[18.1.3]</span>)
2. **Contest** <span class="ref-link">[15.10]</span>: if the opposing team disagrees with the call, the result could be:
  - disc returns to last undisputed thrower <span class="ref-link">[1.12, 13.3, 17.2.2, 17.5.3, 17.9.1]</span>
  - and/or the stall count restarts at max 6 <span class="ref-link">[9.5.4]</span> (or 8 for contested stall-out <span class="ref-link">[9.5.3]</span>)
3. **Retracted**: if the player who made the call subsequently determines that their call was incorrect, they can retract the call - and the stall count resumes as if that player caused a rule breach <span class="ref-link">[15.11, 15.9]</span>

Discussions should be as brief as possible with the preferred outcome being either a retracted call, or an accepted call <span class="ref-link">[annotations 1.10]</span>.

## Turnovers during calls

If, after a call is made, the thrower still throws the disc <span class="ref-link">[16.2.1-16.2.3]</span> and it is *not caught*, it will *often* count as a turnover <span class="ref-link">[annotations 16.1-16.2]</span>:
- If defense made the call, then the turnover stands because the team that called the foul gained possession <span class="ref-link">[16.2.4.1, 19.1.6, 19.2.3.1]</span>
- If offense made the call, then the turnover stands if the foul did not actually affect the turnover <span class="ref-link">[16.3, 18.1.6, 19.1.6, 19.2.3.1]</span>
- If the foul affected the throw itself then it is reasonable that the foul affected play and therefore the disc should go back to the thrower <span class="ref-link">[16.2.4.2.1, 19.2.3.1]</span>
- If the foul *call* caused the catch to be incomplete, e.g. the receiver stopped running because of the call, the disc should go back to the thrower <span class="ref-link">[16.2.4.2.1, 19.2.3.1]</span>
