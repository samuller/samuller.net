# Welcome

Welcome to my home page. I'm a software developer with further interests in computer vision and machine learning, as well as everything from maths and logic to physics and behavioural economics. This site is mainly to collect some notes, summaries and material that I commonly need to reference. Some quotes might also make their appearance.
