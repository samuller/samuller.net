They must find it difficult... Those who have taken authority as truth, rather than truth as the authority.	Gerald Massey
Whenever science makes a discovery, the devil grabs it while the angels are debating the best way to use it.	Alan Valentine
Scientists should always state the opinions upon which their facts are based.
That theory is worthless. It isn't even wrong!	Wolfgang Pauli
Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little; it is only its mathematical properties that we can discover.	Bertrand Russell
Quantum properties can only be seen when you are watching them.
I tell the truth not to convince those who do not know it, but to defend those that do.	William Blake
Physics is like sex. Sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it.	Richard Feynman
"Clarke's three ""laws"" of prediction:<ol><li>When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.</li><li>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.</li><li>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</li></ol>"	Arthur C. Clarke
The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers, he's one who asks the right questions.	Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss
Time is what keeps everything from happening at once.	Karamazov Brothers
There was a blithe certainty that came from first comprehending the full Einstein field equations, arabesques of Greek letters clinging tenuously to the page, a gossamer web. They seemed insubstantial when you first saw them, a string of squiggles. Yet to follow the delicate tensors as they contracted, as the superscripts paired with subscripts, collapsing mathematically into concrete classical entities - potential; mass; forces vectoring in a curved geometry - that was a sublime experience. The iron fist of the real, inside the velvet glove of airy mathematics.	Gregory Benford, Timescape
I think it was Niven who wrote that a real scientist was one who'd fearlessly peer through the gates of hell if he thought he could learn something.
Elementary particles are frequently labelled with Greek letters, to confuse the layman.
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.	Albert Einstein	It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.
First get your facts; then you can distort them at your leisure.	Mark Twain
"Aristotle said that, if light had a finite speed it would have to be very great and asserted ""the strain upon our powers of belief is too great"" to believe this."
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.
To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell. And so it is with science.	 Richard P. Feynman
