Mathematics is the supreme judge; from its decisions there is no appeal.	Tobias Dantzig

There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics.	Benjamin Disraeli
Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost.  Rigour should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere.	W.S. Anglin
It is a mathematical fact that fifty percent of all doctors graduate in the bottom half of their class.
As intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. Look, I made a graph. I make a lot of graphs.	Lisa, The Simpsons
The trouble with integers is that we have examined only the very small ones.  Maybe all the exciting stuff happens at really big numbers, ones we can't even begin to think about in any very definite way.  Our brains have evolved to get us out of the rain, find where the berries are, and keep us from getting killed.  Our brains did not evolve to help us grasp really large numbers or to look at things in a hundred thousand dimensions.	Ronald L. Graham
If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.	John Louis von Neumann
Torture numbers, and they'll confess to anything.	Gregg Easterbrook
Statistics are like bikinis.  What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.	Aaron Levenstein

If one dies, it's a tragedy, if a million dies, it's a statistic...	Kurt Tucholsky, Französischer Witz
Do not put your faith in what statistics say until you have carefully considered what they do not say.	William W. Watt
Then there is the man who drowned crossing a stream with an average depth of six inches.	W.I.E. Gates
There are two kinds of statistics, the kind you look up and the kind you make up.	Rex Stout, Death of a Doxy
Satan delights equally in statistics and in quoting scripture....	H.G. Wells, The Undying Fire
The average human has one breast and one testicle.	Des McHale
A statistical analysis, properly conducted, is a delicate dissection of uncertainties, a surgery of suppositions.	M.J. Moroney
"Statisticians speak of something called the Paradox of the False Positive. Here's how that works: imagine that you've got a disease that strikes one in a million people, and a test for the disease that's 99% accurate. You administer the test to a million people, and it will be positive for around 10,000 of them – because for every hundred people, it will be wrong once (that's what 99% accurate means). Yet, statistically, we know that there's only one infected person in the entire sample. That means that your ""99% accurate"" test is wrong 9,999 times out of 10,000!"
The plural of anecdote is not evidence.
